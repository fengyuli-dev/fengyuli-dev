👋 Hi, I’m Li Fengyu 李丰语.  
✈️ From Wuhan, China => Ithaca, NY.  
🏫 I'm a first year CS undergraduate at Cornell University.  
🌱 I’m currently learning data structures, algebra, and machine learning.  
:sailboat: I'm an active member of [Cornell Design & Tech Initiative](https://www.cornelldti.org/)! We make fun projects that improve the Cornell community!  
🎹 I'm a piano and classical music enthusiast. I should hopefully practice piano 40 hours a day.:thinking:
