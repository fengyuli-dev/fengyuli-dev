I am an undergraduate studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Cornell University, with research interests in multimodal learning and large language models. I conduct research with Cornell University Artificial Intelligence and Meta AI, and volunteer as an ML developer for arXiv, the foremost platform for academic preprints.
